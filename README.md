# TMobileBillReader
With this project we will able to enter a pdf bill and extract information from the bill 
enabling to give us the exact amount everyone pays in the bill.

This Project is a personal project. With a given Tmobile PDF Bill it should let you know how much each person pays in the bill.

Problems with just looking at the bill.

1) Sometimes Bill is confusing
2) Bill doesnt tell you how much individual pays. Its a problem for non-family(ironically) bills. 
3) Doesnt show exactly evenly how much individuals, EVENLY. Some people say that it doesnt, but it doesnt. 
It only gives you how much each person pays according to TMOBILE. But its not evenly. 
4) To many Pages sometimes, depends if you have a lot of people in the bill. It might take forever to scroll for every person.

Future Solutions and Solutions with this program.
1) Gives Important information right in front of you PER PERSON.
2) Gives Evenly Bill per person, giving an exact Bill for everyone.
3) and much more just not able to add everything today. 

This was a problem for me, being with Tmobile for quite a long time, decided to make a program that solves my problem. Instead of figuring
out how much everyone owes in person every month. This program may help me calculate everything quick giving just one bill.
